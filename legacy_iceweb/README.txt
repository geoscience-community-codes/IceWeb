This is the version of IceWeb I wrote during my postdoc from March 12, 1998 to January 7, 2000. It includes all the code, including the Perl CGI codes and the MATLAB codes, and it includes distance, response, wind data, and the output reduced displacement data. It also includes log files, system emails (probably including alarm emails) and the HTML pages and plots from the webserver. This was running on westdahl.giseis.alaska.edu and I moved it from my Dropbox 199803 IceWeb1.0 folder on 2023/04/13, so that folder now just includes reports and early attempts to write a paper or open-file report.
