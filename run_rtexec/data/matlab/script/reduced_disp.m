function w = reducedisp_calc(w,dist,varargin)

% WAVEFORM = REDUCEDISP(WAVEFORM,DISTANCE) This function calculates the
% reduced displacement of a waveform. If not specified, the body wave
% algorithm is used. In most cases the input waveform should be
% pre-filtered to the desired frequency band. This function requires that
% the waveform be a velocity record with units of nm/s. The distance to the
% presumed source, DISTANCE, must be in kilometers. If w is a vector, D
% will be returned as a vector of the same size. Units are cm^2. 
%
% WAVEFORM = REDUCEDISP(WAVEFORM,DISTANCE,ALGORITHM) where ALGORITHM can 
% be specified as either 'BODY' or 'SURF' to impliment the body wave or 
% surface wave formulation.

% "0.0001 converts nm*km to cm^2"

% frequency into integration. This resulted in another factor of 100, thus
% compensating for this mistake. Freak, but true.
